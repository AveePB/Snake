Snake Game in Python with Pygame

This is a remake of the classic game Snake, created using Python and the Pygame library. 
The objective of the game is to eat as many pieces of food as possible without running 
into the walls or the snake's own tail. The more food the snake eats, the longer 
it becomes and the higher the score.

How to Play:
-To start the game, run the main.py file using Python. You can do this by navigating to 
the directory where the file is located and running the following command:python snake.py
-Once the game starts, use the arrow keys to control the snake. The up arrow moves the 
snake upwards, the down arrow moves it downwards, the left arrow moves it to the left, 
and the right arrow moves it to the right.
-The snake will automatically move forward, so you need to be careful not to run into 
the walls or the snake's own tail. If you do, the game will end.

Requirements:
-To run this game, you need to have Python 3.x and the Pygame library installed on your system. 
You can install Pygame using pip by running the following command:pip install pygame

Customization:
-If you want to customize the game, you can do so by modifying the values in the settings.py file.

Credits:

game was created by Nokia in the late 1990s.
